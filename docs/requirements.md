# Requirements Document

## Introduction

RezGenie is an AI-powered resume optimization platform that helps job seekers improve their resumes by analyzing job descriptions, identifying skill gaps, and providing personalized recommendations. The system uses advanced AI to parse resumes, compare them against job requirements, and offer actionable insights through a "genie wishes" system that provides daily recommendations for resume improvement.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want to create an account and securely log in, so that I can access my personalized resume analysis and recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the registration page THEN the system SHALL display fields for email, password, and password confirmation
2. WHEN a user submits valid registration information THEN the system SHALL create a new account and send a JWT token
3. WHEN a user attempts to register with an existing email THEN the system SHALL display an error message
4. WHEN a user logs in with valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate them and provide a JWT token
5. WHEN a user provides invalid login credentials THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
6. WHEN a user's JWT token expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want to upload my resume in PDF or DOCX format, so that the system can analyze my skills and experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria for Requirement 2

1. WHEN a user uploads a PDF or DOCX file THEN the system SHALL parse the text content and extract relevant information
2. WHEN the resume is successfully parsed THEN the system SHALL store the text content and generate embeddings for semantic analysis
3. WHEN a user uploads an unsupported file format THEN the system SHALL display an error message
4. WHEN a user uploads a file larger than 10MB THEN the system SHALL reject the upload with an appropriate message
5. WHEN the parsing is complete THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation and show extracted key information
6. WHEN resume parsing fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error feedback and allow re-upload

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want to input job descriptions and compare them with my resume, so that I can understand how well I match the requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria for Requirement 3

1. WHEN a user pastes or types a job description THEN the system SHALL process the text and generate embeddings
2. WHEN job description processing is complete THEN the system SHALL compare it against the user's resume using semantic similarity
3. WHEN the comparison is complete THEN the system SHALL display a similarity score as a percentage
4. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL highlight missing skills and qualifications
5. WHEN no resume is uploaded THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to upload a resume first
6. WHEN the job description is too short (less than 50 words) THEN the system SHALL request more detailed information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want to receive AI-powered recommendations through a "genie wishes" system, so that I can get personalized advice for improving my resume.

#### Acceptance Criteria for Requirement 4

1. WHEN a user accesses the genie wishes feature THEN the system SHALL display their remaining daily wishes (maximum 3 per day)
2. WHEN a user makes a wish request THEN the system SHALL use OpenAI API to generate personalized recommendations
3. WHEN generating recommendations THEN the system SHALL consider the user's resume content and recent job comparisons
4. WHEN a user has used all 3 daily wishes THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating they must wait until the next day
5. WHEN the daily limit resets (at midnight UTC) THEN the system SHALL restore the user's wish count to 3
6. WHEN displaying recommendations THEN the system SHALL categorize them (missing skills, ATS optimization, formatting tips)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want to view a dashboard with my resume analysis history and recommendations, so that I can track my progress and access previous insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria for Requirement 5

1. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display their uploaded resume status and key metrics
2. WHEN displaying the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show recent job comparisons with similarity scores
3. WHEN showing recommendations THEN the system SHALL display recent genie wishes and their responses
4. WHEN a user has no activity THEN the system SHALL display onboarding guidance and next steps
5. WHEN displaying metrics THEN the system SHALL show total comparisons performed and average similarity scores
6. WHEN the user clicks on a previous comparison THEN the system SHALL display the detailed results

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to handle file storage securely and efficiently, so that user data is protected and the system performs well.

#### Acceptance Criteria for Requirement 6

1. WHEN a user uploads a resume file THEN the system SHALL store it securely in AWS S3 or MinIO for development
2. WHEN storing files THEN the system SHALL use unique identifiers to prevent naming conflicts
3. WHEN processing files THEN the system SHALL scan for malware and reject suspicious uploads
4. WHEN a user deletes their account THEN the system SHALL remove all associated files from storage
5. WHEN accessing stored files THEN the system SHALL verify user ownership and permissions
6. WHEN storage operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling and user feedback

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to process AI operations asynchronously, so that the user interface remains responsive during heavy computations.

#### Acceptance Criteria for Requirement 7

1. WHEN a user uploads a resume THEN the system SHALL queue the parsing and embedding generation as background jobs
2. WHEN processing job comparisons THEN the system SHALL use Celery workers to handle OpenAI API calls asynchronously
3. WHEN background jobs are running THEN the system SHALL provide real-time status updates to the user
4. WHEN a background job fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times before marking it as failed
5. WHEN jobs are queued THEN the system SHALL display estimated completion times to users
6. WHEN the system is under heavy load THEN background jobs SHALL be prioritized appropriately

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want the system to be fast and reliable, so that I can efficiently analyze multiple job opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria for Requirement 8

1. WHEN a user performs a job comparison THEN the system SHALL return results within 30 seconds
2. WHEN the system experiences high traffic THEN response times SHALL not exceed 60 seconds for any operation
3. WHEN the database is queried THEN the system SHALL use efficient indexing for fast retrieval
4. WHEN generating embeddings THEN the system SHALL cache results to avoid redundant API calls
5. WHEN the system encounters errors THEN it SHALL provide meaningful error messages and recovery options
6. WHEN performing similarity searches THEN the system SHALL leverage pgvector for optimized vector operations

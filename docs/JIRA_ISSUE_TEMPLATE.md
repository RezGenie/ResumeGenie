## Issue Details

**Summary:** Fix Wish History Display - Wishes Not Appearing in History List

**Issue Type:** Bug

**Priority:** Medium

**Components:** Frontend, UI/UX

**Labels:** frontend, bug, user-experience, genie-feature

## Description

### Problem
When users make a wish on the Genie page, the wish gets processed and shows results, but it doesn't appear in the "Your Wish History" section below. This creates a poor user experience as users can't track their previous requests.

### Expected Behavior

- When a user submits a wish (resume analysis), it should immediately appear in the wish history
- The wish should show as "processing" status initially
- Once completed, the wish should update to "completed" status with results
- Wishes should be displayed in reverse chronological order (newest first)

### Current Behavior

- Wish gets processed and shows results in the main analysis section
- Daily wish count increments correctly
- BUT wish does not appear in the history list below
- History section remains empty with "No wishes yet!" message

### Technical Details

- **File:** `frontend/src/app/genie/page.tsx`
- **Issue:** `handleSubmit` function doesn't add wish to `wishes` state array
- **Component:** Wish History section correctly renders wishes array but array remains empty

## Acceptance Criteria

‚úÖ **FIXED** - When user submits a wish, it appears immediately in wish history with "processing" status
‚úÖ **FIXED** - Wish updates to "completed" status when analysis finishes
‚úÖ **FIXED** - Wishes display in reverse chronological order
‚úÖ **FIXED** - Wish history shows proper icons, timestamps, and status badges

- [ ] **TODO** - Add error handling for failed wishes
- [ ] **TODO** - Persist wish history in backend/database
- [ ] **TODO** - Add wish details expansion/collapse

## Fix Implementation

**Solution Applied:**

1. Modified `handleSubmit` function to create `newWish` object
2. Added wish to `wishes` state array immediately when processing starts
3. Updated wish status and results when analysis completes
4. Maintained proper TypeScript typing for wish results

**Code Changes:**

- ‚úÖ Added wish creation with proper `Wish` interface
- ‚úÖ Added wish to history with "processing" status
- ‚úÖ Updated wish with "completed" status and results
- ‚úÖ Used `crypto.randomUUID()` for unique wish IDs

## Testing Steps

1. Go to Genie page (`/genie`)
2. Upload a resume file
3. Enter job posting text
4. Click "Make Your Wish" button
5. ‚úÖ Verify wish appears in history with "processing" status
6. Wait for analysis to complete
7. ‚úÖ Verify wish updates to "completed" status
8. ‚úÖ Verify results are accessible in history
9. Make another wish
10. ‚úÖ Verify wishes appear in chronological order
